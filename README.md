# Password-Generator
A Password generator mini project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Soon it will be updated with a custom selection of which type of password the user wants, like only with alphabets and numbers or uppercase alphabets and symbols, etc.. also it will be updated with a separate option for a random duplicate/fake name with numbers and symbols.
